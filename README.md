Observational Astronomy

This course will cover observational techniques in astrophysics with a
decidedly practical applications perspective - i.e. you'll be coding, you'll be
doing data analysis, and you probably won't be doing much deriving. ASTR 310 or
strong familiarity with Python is required. We'll be covering gamma ray, x-ray,
ultraviolet, visible, infrared, sub-mm, mm, and radio astronomy; photometry,
imaging, spectroscopy, and polarimetry; gravitational waves; cosmic rays;
neutrinos; positional astronomy; noise; statistics; data analysis; optics, and
writing proposals to use the facilities we'll talk about.
